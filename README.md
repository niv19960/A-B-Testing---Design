# A-B-Testing---Design

Comparing two different designs of the same website page - the current design versus the new design.
- Design a hypothesis test based on confidence intervals, significance levels, and power analysis.
- A set of different statistical tests are performed, including a two-tailed t-test,       a p-value, and a sign test calculated using the binomial distribution. 
- Experimental conclusion: The new design is unlikely to be better than the old design.
